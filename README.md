# Neurosity SDK

The Neurosity software processes and manages the data produced by [Neurosity headsets](https://neurosity.co) which measures, tracks and monitors EEG brainwaves.

This repository is where [Neurosity](https://neurosity.co) develops the SDK. This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](./LICENSE) and the documentation is can be found on [docs.neurosity.co](https://docs.neurosity.co/). Thank you for visiting this repository.

This README file is a hub to give you some information about the SDK. At a high-level we seek to use the SDK to provide the following solutions:

- Universal JavaScript support: Node/Browser/Electron
- Event-driven multi-client real-time architecture
- Time synchronize clients to Neurosity devices
