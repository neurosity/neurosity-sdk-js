## The Repository

This repository ("`NotionJS API`") is where we (Neurosity) develop the [Notion](https://neurosity.co) API. Not only do we work on code and issues here, but we also publish our [roadmap](https://github.com/neurosity/notion-js/blob/master/ROADMAP.md). This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license]
Thank you for visiting the NotionJS repository.

## NotionJS

This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the NotionJS API. At a high-level we seek to use the NotionJS to provide the following solution:

* Universal JavaScript support: Node/Browser/Electron
* Firebase + Custom Metric Subscriber
* Event-driven multi-client real-time architecture
* Time synchronized imagined thought training

Using NotionJS allows you to quickly integrate Notion so you can begin extending the capabilities of your Notion.
