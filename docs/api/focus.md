title: Focus

Constantly fires and predicts user's focus level from passive cognitive state based on the gamma brainwave between `30Hz` and `44Hz`. Focus is a probability from `0.0` to `1.0`. To get focus over `0.3` is significant. Focus will take up to 16 seconds to fully initialize. 

```js
import { Notion } from "@neurosity/notion";

const mind = new Notion();

mind.focus().subscribe(focus => {
  console.log(focus);
});

// { probability: 0.51, metric: "awareness", label: "focus", timestamp:  1569961321102 }
// { probability: 0.56, metric: "awareness", label: "focus", timestamp:  1569961321106 }
// { probability: 0.62, metric: "awareness", label: "focus", timestamp:  1569961321111 }

// Demo
mind.focus().subscribe(({ probability }) => {
  if (probability > 0.5) {
    notifications.off();
  }
});
```
