title: Migrating from v6 to v7
---

The new version 7 of the SDK is mostly backwards compatible with v6.

There are some small breaking changes.

### 1. TypeScript Types import path change

All TypeScript types are now imported directly from the `@neurosity/sdk` path.

There's not longer a need to reference them from the `@neurosity/neurosity/dist/esm/{typeName}` path.

Before:

```ts
import { DeviceStatus } from "@neurosity/sdk/dist/esm/types/status";
```

After:

```ts
import { DeviceStatus } from "@neurosity/sdk";
```

### Consolidated bundles

In v6 and prior, the SDK exported a custom bundle for Electron. In v7, the default import "@neurosity/sdk" will now use the same bundle as the browser and Node.js imports.

Before:

```ts
import { Neurosity } from "@neurosity/sdk/dist/electron";
```

After:

```ts
import { Neurosity } from "@neurosity/sdk";
```
