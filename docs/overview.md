title: NotionJS
---
NotionJS is built with privacy and ease of use  in mind. Our goal is to make the next major computing platform, a new system, that learns from you. A computing platform is a place filled with applications built by Neurosity and many other developers. The first step in building a platform for us to build on. This repository is used by the Neurosity team to build our very own applications. We have a dream that some of the best apps will be written by people outside of Neurosity.

This documentation describes:

* How to authenticate, query, train, and use a Notion
* How to take advantage of Neurosity's rich NotionJS API
* Where to find guides and code samples to help get you started
