title: NotionJS
---
NotionJS is built with privacy and ease of use  in mind. Our dream is to build the next major computing platform, a new system, that learns from you via symbiotic computing. A computing platform is a place filled with applications built by millions of developers. The first step in building this new platform is to make applications that add value. To make applications quickly, easily, and accessible by any number of clients, we use NotionJS. This repository is used by the Neurosity team to build our very own applications. We have a dream that some of the best apps will be written by people outside of Neurosity.

This documentation describes:

* How to authenticate, query, train, and use a Notion
* How to take advantage of Neurosity's NotionJS
* Where to find guides and code samples to help get you started

Jump right over to [building your first application with Notion](getting-started).

## What can NotionJS do?

Here are some examples of what you can achieve with NotionJS:

* Authenticate and access a Notion - [Authentication](api/authentication)
