NotionJS is built with ease of use and privacy in mind. Our goal is to make the next major computing platform. A computing platform is a place filled with applications built by Neurosity and many other developers. The first step in building a platform with a simple API, so anyone could get started. We believe some of the best apps will be written by people outside of Neurosity.

This documentation describes:

* How to authenticate, query, train, and use a Notion
* How to take advantage of Neurosity's rich NotionJS API
* Where to find guides and code samples to help get you started

## What can NotionJS do?

Here are some exampels of what you can achieve with NotionJS API:

* Authenticate and access a Notion - [Authentication](docs/api/authenticate)
* Query device status - [Info](docs/api/info) or [Status](docs/api/status)
* Check signal quality - [Signal Quality](docs/api/signal-quality)
* Peer into mental states of a person - [Calm](docs/api/calm) or [Focus](docs/api/focus)
* Train a new thought - [Training](guides/training)
* Use a trained thought for control - [Kinesis](docs/api/kinesis)

## How to use NotionJS?

Building a good application with NotionJS can take a lot of effort. Here is what each section of the API doc can help you with:

* **Get Started** teaches fundamental concepts for using NotionJS
* **Guides** includes in-depth guides on various NotionJS development topics, such as [ethics](guides/ethics) and [training](guides/training).
* **References** contains exhaustive references for the [NotionJS API](docs/api).
